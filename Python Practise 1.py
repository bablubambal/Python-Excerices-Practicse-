Python Practice problem 1 (Easy, 10 points)
Your Age In 2090
Take age or year or birth as an input from the user and tell
them when they will turn 100 years old.(5 points)
 Donâ€™t use any type of module like datetime or dateutils(-5 points).

They can then optionally provide a year and your program must tell their age in that particular year.
 (3 points) You should be handling all sorts of errors like (2 points):
You are not yet born
You seem to be the oldest person alive
You can also handle any other error if possible!
