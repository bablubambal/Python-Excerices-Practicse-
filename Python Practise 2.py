Problem Statement:
Harry potter has got n number of apples. Harry has some students among whom,
 he wants to distribute the apples.
  These n number of apples are provided to harry by his friends and he
  can request for few more or few less apples.

You need to print whether a number in range mn to mx is a divisor of n or not.

Input:
Take input n, mn and mx from the user

Output:
Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisor of n or not.

 If mn = mx, show that this is not a range and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number

Example:
If n is 20 and mn=2 and mx = 5

2 is a divisor of 20

3 is not a divisor of 20

â€¦

5 is a divisor of 20

    try:
        n = int(input("Enter n\n"))
        mn = int(input("Enter the min\n"))
        mx = int(input("Enter the max\n"))
        break
    except Exception as e:
        print("U enterd wrong please enter correct")
if mn==mx:
    print("This is not a range..")
    print(mn/n)
    exit()

for i in range(mn,mx+1):
    if n%i ==0:
        print(f"{i} is divisor the divisor {n}")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is not a divisor {n}")
